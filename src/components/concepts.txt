1. File elaboration

    -> public - This contains static files (not processed by React).

    -> src - all components and react, css file is there

    -> app.jsx    - main component which first render by main.jsx 
                  - all components are in this
                  - control what the user see  

    -> app.css    - styles specific to App

    -> main.jsx   - Attach React to the browser

    -> index.html - root of react application   
                  - entry point of application
                  - contains meta data of application

    -> index.css  - global style

    -> json file  - use to store data in key value pair     

    -> flow:
    
        index.html
            ↓
        main.jsx / index.js
            ↓
        app.jsx
            ↓
        Your components
        
    

2.  -> need to close all tags even <br> or any

    -> use ternary operator instead of if else

    -> only return one tag means <div></div> write all stuff between this two

3.  -> components name must in capital

    -> no rule to same name of file and component

4.  there are two type of functions

    -> arrow function  
       
    -   import React from 'react'                                       (default export)

        const FooterComponent = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                
            </div>
        )
        }

        export default FooterComponent

    --  import FooterComponent from './components/FooterComponent.jsx' (default import)
        
    -   import React from 'react'                                  (non default export)

        export const FooterComponent = () => {
        return (
            <div>FooterComponent</div>
        )
        }

    --  import {FooterComponent} from './components/FooterComponent.jsx'(default import)
    
    ->  normal function

    -   import React from 'react'                                      (default export1)

        export default function ContentComponent() {
        return (
            <div></div>
        )
        }
    
    --  import ContentComponent from './components/ContentComponent.jsx'
        
    -   import React from 'react'                                      (default export2)

        function ContentComponent() {
        return (
            <div></div>
        )
        }

        export default ContentComponent
    
    --  import ContentComponent from './components/ContentComponent.jsx'

    -   export function TestComponent ()  {                         (non default export)

        return (
        <div>
            <h1>This is test component</h1>
        </div>
        )
        }

    --  import { TestComponent } from './components/ContentComponent.jsx'
    
    -   {} its called named export

5.  class and className Difference

    -> class is reserved word in react so if we write class its generate error.

6.  foreach and map Difference

    -> forEach → returns nothing (undefined)

       map → returns a new array
    
    -> map is used to render lists, forEach is not used for rendering

    -> forEach → used to do something with each item

       map → used to transform items and get a new array

7.  {
            cars.map((c)=>{
                return <h1>{c}</h1>   //run error free
            })
    }


    {
            cars.map((c)=>{
                return 
				<h1>{c}</h1>    //generate error write return statment beside the return
            })
    }

    {
            cars.map((c)=>{
                return (
					<h1>{c}</h1> // want to write below must use ()
					)
            })
    }

8.  React Routing

    -> first fire this command in terminal  'npm i react-router-dom'. need for install route

    -> <BrowserRouter> it enables routing in react application. write in "main.jsx"  

    -> - Link: Creates navigation links that update the URL
       - Routes: A container for all your route definitions
       - Route: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a component

    -> Single Page Applications (SPA), so routing is handled inside JavaScript, not by the browser.

    -> Routing means handling navigation between different views. 
     
    -> use Link tag instead of a

9.  routing 

    -> When the URL changes, show a different page (component).

       - /home      → Home page
         /about     → About page

    dynamic routing

    -> Part of the URL can change, but the page stays the same
       
       - /users/1
         /users/2
         /users/99
       - 1, 2, 99 are dynamic
       - The component is stil same

       - <Route path="/users/:id" element={<User />} />
       - :id → dynamic value
       - id is called a route parameter

10. spread operator

    -> [...users, "royal"]
       
       - create a new array
       - copy all existing values from users
       - add "royal" at the end

       - Memory Heap  users    ──▶ 0xA1 ──▶ ["karan", "aman"]
                      newUsers ──▶ 0xB2 ──▶ ["karan", "aman", "royal"]

       - New memory address (0xB2)
       - Original data untouched

       - setUsers(newUsers);
         oldUsers (0xA1) !== newUsers (0xB2)
       - React sees change → ✅ re-render
    
    push

    -> const addUser = () => {
         users.push("royal");
         setUsers(users);
       };

       - push mutates the existing array
       - It does NOT create a new array
       - here value in array is updated but UI must same not change data in webpage

       - Memory Heap --> users ──▶ 0xA1 ──▶ ["karan", "aman", "royal"]

       - oldUsers (0xA1) === newUsers (0xA1) 
       - React thinks nothing changed → ❌ no re-render


11. Immutability = you do NOT change the original data, stat.
    Instead, you create a NEW copy with the changes.

12. hooks --> there several hooks in react

    -> Hooks must always be called at the top level of your function. Don't put them inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

    -> Hooks are functions introduced in React that allow functional components to manage state and use lifecycle features without using class components.


    *useParams: Reads dynamic values from the URL

        -> as mention above :id , useParams read the value and update the value in UI

    *useState: When that data changes, React automatically re-renders the component to show the  update.

        -> const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
           
           - state: The current value (like a variable).
           - setState: A function used to update that value.(seter function)
           - initialValue: The value the state starts with (could be a number, string, array, or object).

        -> setCount instead of just count = count + 1 ?
    
           - If you just change a variable, React has no idea it changed. By using the setter function (setCount), you notify React that the data is different, which triggers the UI to refresh.

        -> also we can use it for arrays or objects

        ->pros and cons --> useState is simple and great for local state, but it becomes hard to manage for complex or global state logic. rerender application every time and its take high load time use another hook or mechanism

13. fallback 

    -> means that when actual value or img or anything is not load then that default value is shown.

14. props
