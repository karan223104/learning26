1. Form validation

   -> Checking user input before submitting the form to make sure it is correct, complete, and safe.

   -> Without validation:

      - User can submit empty form
      - User can enter wrong email
      - User can enter letters in phone number
      - Data stored in database becomes incorrect
      - Security risks increase

    -> Types of Form Validation
        
        --> Client-Side Validation (Frontend)

            Done in browser using:

            - HTML attributes
            - JavaScript
            - React
            - React Hook Form

            Example:

            - Required field
            - Email format check
            - Password length

        Fast
        Better user experience
        Not fully secure (can be bypassed)

        --> Server-Side Validation (Backend)

            - Done on server using:
            - Node.js
            - PHP
            - Java
            - Python

            Example:

            - Check if email already exists
            - Check password strength
            - Validate database rules

        Secure
        Cannot be bypassed
        Always required
