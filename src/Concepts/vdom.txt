1. vdom is lightweighted copy of real dom

    -> change or manipulation in real dom is expensive
    -> lightweighted, fast, sync-able
    -> stpes:

        - rendering: when any change occur

        - creation of vdom

        - diffing algorithm: React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with a snapshot of the    previous Virtual DOM tree. It uses a highly optimized "diffing" algorithm to find exactly what changed.

        - Reconciliation: Once React knows exactly what changed, it calculates the most efficient way to update the Real DOM.

        -patching: patch the value
