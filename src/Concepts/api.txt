1.  What is an API?

    -> API = Application Programming Interface

       - An API is a bridge that allows two applications to talk to each other.

    -> In MERN:

       - React → sends request
       - Node/Express → receives request
       - Database → sends data back
       - API → sends response to frontend

    -> How JSON is Used in APIs

       - APIs mostly send and receive data in JSON format.
       - Because JSON is: Lightweight, Easy to read, Easy to convert into JavaScript object
